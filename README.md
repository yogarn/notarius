# Notarius
This repository is a project I created while learning PHP and Laravel. It utilizes Blade, the built-in templating engine, to simplify front-end development.
The project is a note-taking and diary app with added features, such as a to-do list, to make the learning process more challenging.

To start the server, simply run `php artisan serve` and `npm run dev`. Make sure PHP, Composer, and NPM are installed correctly, otherwise, the app will fail to start.
